# LATER – Your Personal Curation Assistant

## What it Does
LATER helps users rediscover what they’ve saved online — videos, articles, or podcasts — by turning “Watch Later” into a smart reminder system.

## Why it Matters
People save hundreds of items they never return to. LATER turns that forgotten list into meaningful learning sessions through AI-driven scheduling.

## Who it’s For
Busy creators, professionals, and learners who want to manage their digital curiosity intentionally.

## Key Features
- Smart Queue (auto-categorizes saved content)
- Reminder Engine (timely watch/read notifications)
- Cross-App Sync (YouTube, Twitter, Pocket, etc.)
- Focus Mode (distraction-free return sessions)

## Built With
React • Node.js • MongoDB • YouTube API • Firebase Notifications
